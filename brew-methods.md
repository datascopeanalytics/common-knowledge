There are many ways to make delicious, caffeinated beverages in the Datascope kitchen. Here's a rundown of preferred methods we've discovered over time:

# Coffee
## Nespresso
For the quick fix. 

1. If the button lights on top are alternating, the machine needs to heat up. Push one and they'll start blinking. When they're solidly lit, continue on.
2. Pull up on the lever, insert a pod of your choice, and pull down the lever to lock it in. If the previous pod won't eject, the little waste basket may be full— pull on the silver flip-down shelf on the front to pull the basket out and empty it.
3. Press the button with a small cup for an espresso- you can use the small double-wall Bodum glasses for that. Press the button with a bigger cup for a lungo (more water)— you'll want a slightly larger cup for one of these. Some of the pods are designed to be drank as lungos- look at the packaging.
4. For a Dean-o-ccino (like an Americano), press one of the buttons again to add more hot, slightly brown water.

## Hario V60 Pour-over
Old reliable for making 2 cups or so. 

#### Grind
Medium-fine, try the 12-14 range.

#### Quantities
25-30g of coffee. ~350 grams water (14x), alter to make cup stronger or weaker.

#### Method
- Pour a little water in the filter before adding coffee; this warms the dripper and washes out the carafe. 
- Empty the carafe. 
- At first, pour just enough in (around 50-60g) to wet the grounds and watch them expand and bubble (this is called blooming— it allows the beans to release gases and makes a more even bed to pour over in subsequent pours). 
- Pour slowly until you have the target amount of water, moving in concentric rings from the middle to the outside. It may take a few pours.

## Manual Pour-over
A Kickstarter darling and gift from our friend Neal Patel. Intentionally designed to drain more slowly than a V60; this extracts the coffee more and allows for a courser grind, but can make some coffees taste bitter.

#### Grind
Medium-coarse, try the 20-24 range.

#### Quantities 
`¯\_(ツ)_/¯` should be same as V60, but feel free to run experiments.

#### Method
[Manual suggests](http://www.manual.is/brewing) pouring more aggressive down the center than a traditional pourover. Blooming is still probably a good idea.

## Bodum b.over (lol, that's actually what it's called)
For when you need to make a bunch. Generally considered not as tasty as pour-over or Aeropress (though nobody's done a blind test), but great for making batches for the office or large crowds of visitors, and the pot is insulated to keep coffee warm for hours.

#### Grind
Medium, try 17-19.

#### Quantities
For 10 cups, around 60 grams seems to work. No more than 70 at most.

#### Method
Fill water, add coffee, press button, wait for slurping sound. When you pull the pitcher out, be careful not to pull the bean basket out with it.

## Aeropress
Makes a more concentrated cup, best suited for a single cup of coffee. Lots of ways to experiment with quantities and ratios. Can produce something kind of espresso-like which can be had straight or watered down americano-style.




# Tea
## Turkish Tea


## Looseleaf Tea
