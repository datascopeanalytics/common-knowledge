There are many (7 and counting) ways to make delicious, caffeinated beverages in the Datascope kitchen. Here's a rundown of preferred methods we've discovered over time.

[Nespresso](#nespresso) - [Hario Pour-over](#hario-v60-pour-over-the-ceramic-and-glass-thing) - [Manual Pour-over](#manual-pour-over-the-glass-and-wood-thing) - [Bodum](#bodum-bover-lol-thats-actually-what-its-called) - [Aeropress](#aeropress-the-little-plastic-cylinder-thing) - [Turkish Tea](#turkish-tea) - [Looseleaf Tea](#looseleaf-tea)

# Coffee
## Nespresso
For the quick fix. 

1. If the button lights on top are alternating, the machine needs to heat up. Push one and they'll start blinking. When they're solidly lit, continue on.
2. Pull up on the lever, insert a pod of your choice, and pull down the lever to lock it in. If the previous pod won't eject, the little waste basket may be full— pull on the silver flip-down shelf on the front to pull the basket out and empty it.
3. Press the button with a small cup for an espresso- you can use the small double-wall Bodum glasses for that. Press the button with a bigger cup for a lungo (more water)— you'll want a slightly larger cup for one of these. Some of the pods are designed to be drank as lungos- look at the packaging.
4. For a Dean-o-ccino (like an Americano), press one of the buttons again to add more hot, slightly brown water.

## Hario V60 Pour-over (the ceramic and glass thing)
Old reliable for making 2 cups or so. 

#### Grind
Medium-fine, try the 12-14 range.

#### Quantities
25-30g of coffee. ~350 grams water (14x), alter to make cup stronger or weaker.

#### Method
- Pour a little water in the filter before adding coffee; this warms the dripper and washes out the carafe. 
- Empty the carafe, and wait for the water to cool a bit off the boil. 200°F +/- 5° tends to be the best
- At first, pour just enough in (around 50-60g) to wet the grounds and watch them expand and bubble (this is called blooming— it allows the beans to release gases and makes a more even bed to pour over in subsequent pours). 
- Pour slowly until you have the target amount of water, moving in concentric rings from the middle to the outside. It may take a few pours.

## Manual Pour-over (the glass and wood thing)
A Kickstarter darling and gift from our friend Neal Patel. Intentionally designed to drain more slowly than a V60; this extracts the coffee more and allows for a courser grind, but can make some coffees taste bitter.

#### Grind
Medium-coarse, try the 20-24 range.

#### Quantities 
`¯\_(ツ)_/¯` should be same as V60, but feel free to run experiments.

#### Method
[Manual suggests](http://www.manual.is/brewing) pouring more aggressive down the center than a traditional pourover. All the other parts of the V60 method should still be relevant.

## Bodum b.over (lol, that's actually what it's called)
For when you need to make a bunch. Generally considered not as tasty as pour-over or Aeropress (though nobody's done a blind test), but great for making batches for the office or large crowds of visitors, and the pot is insulated to keep coffee warm for hours.

#### Grind
Medium, try 17-19.

#### Quantities
For 10 cups, around 60 grams seems to work. No more than 70 at most.

#### Method
Fill water, add coffee, press button, wait for slurping sound. When you pull the pitcher out, be careful not to pull the bean basket out with it.

## Aeropress (the little plastic cylinder thing)
Makes a more concentrated cup, best suited for a single cup of coffee. Lots of ways to experiment with quantities and ratios. Can produce something kind of espresso-like which can be had straight or watered down americano-style.

### Method
[This video](https://vimeo.com/62908498) shows the "classic" method, [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMqjk2jZ4AE) shows the inverted method. The inverted method doesn't let any coffee through before steeping, so it generally extracts more. With an Aeropress, you can vary the grind size, stir time, steep time, plunge time, water and coffee quantities, so naturally baristas have their favorite ways to do this (there are actually Aeropress competitions).

Here are a few favorite methods via @bjlange and the Aeropress Timer app on iOS:

#### Espresso-style, from Sweet Maria's [classic method]

- 2 scoops, ground at 12.
- Add 2 shots of water (about 2 ticks on the side of the Aeropress)
- Stir for 20 seconds.
- Add the plunger in the top and steep for 15 seconds.
- Push down and plunge for 15 seconds.

#### The Bold (more like a strong cup of coffee), from Bold Bean [inverted method]

- 1 scoop, ground at 12.
- Add 3.5 shots of water (fill as far as you can with the bloom, leaving a little space for stirring)
- Stir for 45 seconds.
- Add filter, flip, and plunge for 20 seconds.

# Tea
## Turkish Tea
### To brew a pot:

1. Heat water to boiling in the bottom kettle.
2. Add a whole mess of black Turkish tea to the top kettle.
3. Add hot water to top kettle and let steep for 10-15 minutes, turn the burner to "warm"
The tea will stay warm all day without scorching.

### To drink it:
The tea in the top kettle is very concentrated, pour 30-40% of your glass and then top off with hot water. You may also want to add sugar if you prefer.

## Looseleaf Tea
We also have loose leaf tea, a coated iron teapot, and mug infusers if that's more your jam.
