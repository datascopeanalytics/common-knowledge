## Troubleshooting for Datascope pairing desk keyboard + mouse setups

## First things to check
- Ensure you're plugged into the desk Thunderbolt connection. If you're connected to the monitor, this is true.
- Ensure Bluetooth is turned on. Check this by opening your Mac's System Preferences and clicking on Bluetooth in the third row.

## Things that might be wrong
### The keyboard and mouse may be out of juice.
If tapping the power button on the top right of the devices doesn't cause a little light to light up temporarily, they're either turned off or out of battery. Try holding down the button for 5-10 secondsâ€” if they're turned off, this will turn them on. If not, you need to replace the batteries.

### You may be pairing over your computer's internal Bluetooth instead of the desk's builtin Bluetooth module.
To determine this, go to `System Preferences > Bluetooth` and check "Show Bluetooth in menu bar". Now that you can see the Bluetooth logo (kinda looks like a weird B) in your top menu bar, hold down Alt/Option and click it. You should see an "Address" section in the drop down; if you're connected via the desk, the address should start with `5C-F3-70`
