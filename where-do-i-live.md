# Commuting
## Should I drive?
Currently no one at Datascope takes a car to work. You're welcome to buck the trend, but parking costs are steep downtown, and depending on the route you take rush hour traffic can be pretty thick.

So if you're going to take public transit, here are your options:

## In the city: CTA
The Chicago Transit Authority operates most of the public transit within the city, including "L" trains/subways and buses. 

The train lines radiate out from downtown like spokes on a wheel. As such, it's somewhat easier to visit neighborhoods that are on the same train line as you, and the lines each somewhat have their own flavors. More on that below.

It's worth mentioning— people actually use the buses in Chicago. Because the train lines don't cross each other much, buses are useful for moving east/west on the North and South side, and north/south on the West side. 

In the city, living near a train line generally make commuting easier, though there are express buses that use Lake Shore Drive also service parts of the North and South side that are far from the train lines.
 
## In the Burbs: Metra + Pace
Metra operates commuter trains that also more or less radiate from downtown. These go much further and stop less frequently, servicing the suburbs and stretching all the way from Wisconsin to Indiana and even all the way to where Dean lives. Because the stations are further apart most suburbanites drive to the station and park their cars, though you may be able to find a primo place within walking distance of a stop.

Pace is like the CTA for the suburbs— they operate buses in some places. These are an alternative for getting to the Metra or "downtown" developments, if you don;t want to drive.

## Alternatives

Chicago has pretty decent cycling lanes and paths too, and Brian sometimes commutes by bike. If you're relatively close, the city also has a bike share system called Divvy that is very popular, and Datascope provides employees with a complimentary membership. Trips on Divvy that take more than 30 minutes cost extra, so keep that in mind.

Of course, there is also some housing within walking distance of the office, which leads us to...

# Where do I live?
## In the city
There are a few macro level things to grasp about Chicago before we get into neighborhoods.

1. The size— [here](http://www.timeout.com/chicago/blog/how-does-chicago-size-up-to-other-cities) are some comparisons. It takes about 75 minutes (in theory) to traverse from the northern edge at Howard to the southern most Red Line stop at 95th. Most places along train lines are 50 minutes or less to the Loop, where Datascope's office is.

2. It is simultaneously one of the most diverse and segregated cities in America, and this goes for both race and income. [These excellent map visualizations](http://www.radicalcartography.net/index.html?chicagodots) by Bill Rankin demonstrate this. As you can see, most of Chicago's poverty is concentrated on the South and West sides, while the density of wealth is concentrated on the near North side and dissipates as you go north and west. Maps of [shootings](http://crime.chicagotribune.com/chicago/shootings) and [homicides](http://crime.chicagotribune.com/chicago/homicides) show similar patterns. Furthermore, the North side is predominantly white, the Northwest close to the city is a (gentrifying) mixture of white and Hispanic, and there are slices of black and Hispanic communities across the West and South. Exceptions include Rogers Park and Uptown on the North Side, near the universities in Hyde Park and Evanston, Albany Park, and Bridgeport and Pilsen in the Southwest.

These observations are not to suggest where you should live or visit within the city, but to make it clear that many Chicagoans live in "different Chicagos"— it's hard to make generalized statements about the city as a whole, because many communities are highly localized. OK, all that said...

### Neighborhoods
This isn't comprehensive, work in progress.
#### Downtown and nearby
Most expensive rents in the city.
* Loop - Where Chicago works, and tourists go to off-Broadway shows. Nice parks near the lake and the Art Institute + Cultural Center, but not the most livable. Can't beat the commute though!
* West Loop- formerly industrial, now home to some of the hottest restaurants in the city. Rapidly turning into lofts and such as companies like Google move their offices out there. Access via Pink & Green lines.
* South Loop- Like the Loop- great museums + park access, but more livable and slightly cheaper.  Access via Red, Green, Orange, and Blue lines.

#### Red Line
Rents generally decrease as you travel north. All neighborhoods feature beaches + lake access during nice weather. Red Line runs 24/7.
* River North- dense area north of the Loop, lots of restaurants, clubs, shopping. Center of tourism in Chicago. Pricey.
* Gold Coast— More shopping, less restaurants, also v. pricey. If you've ever wondered where the people who actually buy Prada clothing live, this is where.
* Old Town— More neighborhoody than Gold Coast. Home to Second City comedy club/school. Lots of retail + condo density going up around the North/Clybourn stop.
* Lincoln Park— Yuppie, but nice part of town. Areas north and west of Depaul University are more neighborhoody. There's a free zoo in the park here. 
* East Lakeview— Lots of young people live here, good restaurants, home to sub-neighborhoods of Boystown (one of Chicago's gay neighborhoods), Wrigleyville (bros & sports bars abound).
* Buena Park— area north of Wrigleyville but south of Uptown. Good lake access but less crazy than places to the south, a disproportionately high ratio of Datascopers live here as of 02/01/2016.
* Uptown— Historically the cool part of Chicago where Sinatra, Capone and that ilk hung out, nowadays rougher but with signs of revitalization. 
* Edgewater— Home to sub-neighborhoods of Andersonville (historically Swedish and gay neighborhood with great restaurants and shopping) and 
* Rogers Park— diverse slice of Chicago includes Loyola students, Hispanic and other pocket minority communities makes.

#### Brown Line
Brown Line residents are more likely to have kids, enjoy folk music, and/or wear a newsboy cap. Less lake access but not far.
* West Lakeview- the "Southport Corridor" is a little more hipstery than east Lakeview. Nice bars, great independent movie theater, gourmet ice cream, you get it.
* Roscoe Village/North Center- west of West Lakeview on Roscoe. Quieter and perhaps a bit older than Lakeview, Roscoe Village in particular is cute and there are a number of nice bars and restaurants.
* Lincoln Square- hot neighborhood for young families, the Square itself is a pedestrian area with nice restaurants, bars, and shopping. Historically German, still home to a number of German businesses.
* Albany Park- more diverse than other communities on the Brown Line, features immigrant communities and businesses from Mexico, Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. Western parts are also accessible by Blue Line.

#### Blue Line
Generally "hipper" than neighborhoods to the east, and rents are starting to reflect that. Far from the lake.
* Ukranian Village- older crowd than Wicker Park to the North, small coach houses, lots of cool bars 
* Wicker Park- Home to a number of immigrant populations through the years, gentrified towards hipster-types and an increasing number of yuppie bros with hipster tendencies. Lots of food, shopping, and bars, a center of nightlife.
* Bucktown- North of Wicker Park, quieter and more neighborhoody. More families though perhaps not as many as on the Brown Line.
* Logan Square— The current frontier of gentrification along the Blue Line. Young hip people and some young families as well, as well as a sizeable Hispanic population and eccentrics who've been living there for a while. Great restaurants and more parks than the neighborhoods to the Southwest. Milwaukee Avenue very much a nightlife destination these days, but the neighborhood is big enough that it's easy to live far from that if desired.
* Avondale- North of Logan Square, quieter, cheaper, more Hispanic, getting some nice restaurants and bars of its own these days.

#### Southwest Side
* Pilsen- historically Hispanic neighborhood, still fairly diverse though gentrifying. Big arts scene, lots of very hip people.
* Bridgeport- historically white, immigrant, blue-collar neighborhood, becoming younger and more diverse recently. Growing arts scene and some good bars and restaurants.
